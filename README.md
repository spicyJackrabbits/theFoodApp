## Goal
The goal of our application is to make the lives of Hungry and Hangry people easier. When a user goes to our website, they are presented with 2 questions: 1) Are you Hangry or Hungry 2) What are you craving? Depending on the answer, our application gives the user either 1 or 5 local restaurants near them.
## Description
Have you ever turned from Hungry to Hangry in a matter of minutes? We've all been there. Now there's a solution: Hungry Hangry Hippo! This is an app that not only narrows down your cravings but also helps you locate a restaurant based on how you're feeling. Hungry? Our app returns 5 local restaurants based on your food choice within driving distance. Hangry? Our app returns 1 local restaurant based on your food choice that is near you, so you can knock out those hunger pains right away. Decisions made easy!
## Goal
The goal is to suggest a place to eat! We want out app to:
* Ask someone if they're "Hangry or Hungry?" and figure out what they're craving
* Depending on answers, our app will suggest either 1 or 5 restaurants near the user
* We will also inform the user of each restaurants' location
## Challenges and Successes
Our biggest challenges were getting the APIs to call, merging our updates correctly to the repository, and making our site responsive. Our team communication has been a huge success! We opened all lines of communication via Zoom, Slack, and phone, to touch base with each other about questions we have, ideas we've come up with, and etc. We have also been successful with moving towards M.V.P. Our team was very transparent about skill levels. With all four of us being new to coding there were struggles but we all worked hard to grow our skills. In the end, we hoped for M.V.P and we were successful.
