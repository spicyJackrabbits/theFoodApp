# theFoodApp

## Description
I am an indecisve Hungry or Hangry person. I want a suggestion on what I should eat so I can choose what I should eat. Have you ever turned from Hungry to Hangry in a matter of minutes? Trust me we have all been there, but now we have just the solution, Hungry, Hangry, Hippo! Hungry, Hangry, Hippo is an app that not only points you in the right direction of a specific cuisine of your choosing but it also helps you locate a restaurant based on how you're feeling. Hungry? Our app returns 5 local restaurants based on your cuisine of choice within driving distance. Hangry? Our app returns 1 local restaurant based on the cuisine of your choice that is nearest to you so you can knock out those hunger pains right away. Decisions made easy!

## Challenges and Successes
Our biggest challenges were getting the APIs to call. Merging our updates correctly to the created repository and responsiveness. Our team communication has been a huge success with this working project. We have opened all lines of communication via Zoom, Slack and phone to touch base with each other about questions we have, ideas we have come up with, success with moving towards M.V.P among other things. Our team was very transparent about our skill levels. With all four of us being new to coding there are strong points in each of us but also things that we want continue to grow in. As we pushed towards the making of this app each of us tried to get a better understanding of what our other group members were doing in hopes that it would allow us to grow in that area. In the end we hoped for M.V.P and we were successful.
